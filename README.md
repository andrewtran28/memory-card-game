A React web application game that tests your memory. To play, only select the cards that you have previously not clicked before. The card assets show the names and images of random Villagers from the video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Assets were provided by the Nookipedia API.

Known Issues
-Need to create top-level IIFE async function to only require one API reqeust instead for each round.
-Add card-flip animation upon card click (applies to all cards)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
